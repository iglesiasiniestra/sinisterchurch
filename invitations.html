    <h2><i class="fas fa-ticket-alt"></i> Join Our Community</h2>
    <p>At Sinister Church, we have always maintained a close-knit community of individuals who share a commitment to seeking deeper truths and embracing the shadows in order to uncover the light. To ensure that all members align with our vision of truth and the future, we have traditionally operated on an invitation-only basis. In the past, current members personally selected candidates whom they felt were worthy of joining our spiritual journey.</p>

      <p>These handpicked invitations ensured that every member who walked through our doors was someone who shared our dedication to self-discovery, spiritual growth, and the pursuit of truth. It has always been about quality, not quantity, and about cultivating a space where like-minded individuals can thrive together.</p>
      
      <p>However, as we continue to evolve, we are now entering a new phase of expansion. For a limited time, we are opening a few places for new members to join our mother church. This is a rare opportunity for those who are ready to commit themselves to our path and contribute to our unique vision of the future.</p>
      
      <p>If you believe you are ready to take this step, we invite you to reach out. Please fill out the contact form located at the <a href="contact.html">Contact Us link</a> and tell us why you would be a valuable addition to Sinister Church. We encourage you to share your journey, your beliefs, and why you feel drawn to join our community.</p>
      
      <p>This is your chance to become part of something that goes beyond the ordinary—a place where truth is sought, shadows are embraced, and the light within is discovered.
      
      <p>We look forward to hearing from those who feel the calling.</p>
